# Documentation style guide

## Guiding principles

**Inclusive**: Concepts, language and tone are clear, inclusive and accessible by default.

**Iterative**: Perfect is the enemy of good.

**Light**: 11ty supports the indie web and the tone should reflect this! Without sacrificing clarity, the tone should be slightly more weird and fun, less robotic and sterile.

## Language and tone

> [!NOTE]
> TODO: Provide yes/no example of each.

- Write for a global audience.
- Friendly, but not frivolous.
- Use positive constructions, unless pointing out things to specifically avoid.
- Don't assume that the reader already knows what you're talking about.
- Avoid ableist and unnecessarily gendered language.
- Avoid non-inclusive language or terms.
- Use present tense.
- Use active voice, making it clear who performs the action.
- Address the reader directly, using 'you' instead of 'we', 'the user' or 'they'.
- Conditions appear before instructions, not after.

## Style

> [!NOTE]
> TODO: Provide yes/no example of each.

- Use sentence case for document titles and section headings.
- Use descriptive and meaningful link text.
- Use Merriam-Webster.com for spelling.
- Spell out abbreviations on first reference, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses.
- Avoid directional language (for example, above or below).
- Sentences should lead with important information, and ideally fewer than 26 words.

## Formatting

> [!NOTE]
> TODO: Provide yes/no example of each.

- Don't skip levels of the heading hierarchy.
  - Adopt: `<h1>`, then `<h2>`, then `<h3>`
  - Avoid: `<h1>`, then `<h3>`
- Use meaningful link text.
  - Adopt: `<a>read the documentation</a>`
  - Avoid: `<a>click here</a>`
- Use qualifying nouns for technical keywords.
  - Adopt: the `example.yaml` file
  - Avoid: `example.yaml`
- Use bold for `[TODO]`
- Use italics for `[TODO]`
- Use backticks for `[TODO]`
- Use single quotes for `[TODO]`
- Use double quotes for `[TODO]`
