# Documentation style guide

## Guiding principles

**Inclusive**: Concepts, language and tone used is clear, inclusive and accessible by default.

**Iterative**: Release, get feedback, improve. Perfect is the enemy of good.

**Light**: 11ty supports the indie web, and the overall style should reflect this.


## Language and tone

| Guidance                                                                        | Recommended                                           | Not recommended                                   |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| Write for a global audience.                                                    | "Releasing in October 2024."                          | "Releasing this fall."                            |
| Be friendly, but not frivolous.                                                 | "Let's explore this feature!"                         | "This feature has mad rizz."                      |
| Use positive constructions, unless pointing out things to specifically avoid.   | "Ensure that you..."                                  | "Don't forget to..."                              |
| Don't assume that the reader already knows what you're talking about.           | "In Eleventy, collections allow you to..."            | "Collections are used for grouping content.       |
| Avoid ableist, violent and unnecessarily gendered language.                     | "Remove the handmade placeholder file."               | "Kill the man made dummy file."                   |
| Avoid non-inclusive language or terms.                                          | "Open the primary layout."                            | "Open the master layout."                         |
| Use present tense.                                                              | "The following filters are supported."                | "The following filters are now supported."        |
| Use active voice, making it clear who performs the action.                      | "When you send a query, the server sends a response." | "The service is queried, and a response is sent." |
| Address the reader directly, using 'you' instead of 'we', 'the user' or 'they'. | "You can configure..."                                | "The user can configure..."                       |
| Conditions appear before instructions, not after.                               | "If enabled, click save."                             | "Click save if enabled."                          |

## Style

| Guidance                                                                                 | Recommended | Not recommended |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|:----------------|

| Use descriptive and meaningful link text.                                                | `[TODO]`    | `[TODO]`        |
| Use Merriam-Webster.com for spelling.                                                    | `[TODO]`    | `[TODO]`        |
| Spell out abbreviations on first reference, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. | `[TODO]`    | `[TODO]`        |

| Sentences should lead with important information, and ideally fewer than 26 words.       | `[TODO]`    | `[TODO]`        |

|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|:---------------------|
| Don't skip levels of the heading hierarchy.                                                               | `<h1>` &rarr; `<h2>` &rarr; `<h3>` | `<h1>` &rarr; `<h3>` |
| Use meaningful link text.                                                                                 | `<a>read the documentation</a>`    | `<a>click here</a>`  |
| Use qualifying nouns for technical keywords.                                                              | the `example.yaml` file            | `example.yaml`       |
| Use bold to highlight a word or statement, not related to code.                                           | `[TODO]`                           | `[TODO]`             |
| Use italics when referencing people, websites, companies or technologies, unless part of a link.          | `[TODO]`                           | `[TODO]`             |
| Use backticks when referring to file paths and names, along with inline code variables or function names. | `[TODO]`                           | `[TODO]`             |
| Use single quotes when quoting phrases or terms within a sentence, or technical jargon.                   | `[TODO]`                           | `[TODO]`             |
| Use double quotes when quoting full sentences, blocks of text, or when quoting external sources verbatim. | `[TODO]`                           | `[TODO]`             |
