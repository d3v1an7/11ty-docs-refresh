# Layout/visual

- @rdela: a more [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) style layout, moving our table of ‚ÄúContents‚Äù outline and jump links from the top of the article to a sidebar on the right, if the screen is wide enough, that follows you down the page and highlights the section of your current scroll position. See for example: [&lt;details&gt;: The Details disclosure element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details)
  - Worth noting that [Tugboat](https://tugboat.11ty.dev/) has this already on the left sidebar via [table-of-contents.webc](https://github.com/11ty/tugboat/blob/main/_components/table-of-contents.webc)
- @rdela: One really long page can feel overwhelming, although it does allow one to use find on page, which can be super helpful to find all occurrences of a term.

# Content

- @rknightuk: (paraphrased) A collection of first-party tutorials that cover common needs (One for a blog, a marketing site, portfolio, one that pulls in external data to make posts/pages, maybe one that pulls all those concepts together.)
- @rdela: Our [Community](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/community/) page could probably improve by evaluating and incorporating good parts of [MDN‚Äôs Commuity Page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/community), which links to their [Getting started with MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Contributing/Getting_started) guide to contributing.

# Topics

### WebC

- @rdela: [WebC](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/) by itself seems expansive enough to have a whole section of docs, examples, and learning paths.
  - I like the [Recipes on 11ty ‚ô• WebC](https://11tywebcfun.netlify.app/recipes/) by [@darthmall](https://github.com/darthmall)
  - whose Oct 15, 2022 [Introduction to WebC](https://11ty.rocks/posts/introduction-webc/) also...*rocks!*
  - as does [Understanding WebC Features and Concepts](https://11ty.rocks/posts/understanding-webc-features-and-concepts/) Oct 24, 2022 by [@5t3ph](https://github.com/5t3ph) (particularly helped me [debugging errors](https://github.com/rdela/eleventeen/pull/40#issuecomment-2243329000)). The rest of 11ty Rocks! is also worth taking stock of, I hear it mentioned frequently as a learning resource.

    > One area where I would say Eleventy is a little lacking is the documentation. It feels slightly harder to navigate than Gatsby's docs, in that you kind of need to have an idea of what you're looking for. The [Getting Started](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/) tutorial assumes a certain level of knowledge, and in that regard it's not quite as beginner-friendly for someone who might not already be familiar with static site generators.

  - @JackieGable: After trying 3 times before (in the past 2 years) to transition my website from Jekyll to Eleventy, I finally decided it was time to get serious about it. The Eleventy documentation was the problem for me each time I tried to make the move. Even though it's extensive, it's all-over-the-place and not beginner friendly. So, I began searching YouTube for tutorials on getting started with Eleventy, and I was disappointed. Zach teaches a few but he doesn't approach it from a beginner's point of view. [‚Ä¶]  I'm planning on reaching out to Brad Traversy, (https://www.traversymedia.com) my favorite YouTube teacher, to see if he might be interested in teaching a beginner's course on Eleventy. Brad knows how to explain things in simple terms (teach me like I'm Five) and doesn't assume anything.
    I truly believe that more people would learn to use Eleventy if there was better documentation and video tutorials available. Since I am a beginner to Eleventy, I can certainly contribute the documentation that I write for myself once I learn a new concept.

    > First of all, the 11ty documentation seems to be designed for people who already know what they are looking for. This is a typical bias from the people who create the documentation, as they are already familiar with the material.
    > 
    > I have a long history of improving extensive documentation for my past employers, and the first thing I always start with is a general question: Can I follow the stream of thoughts when reading the docs? Does it have a well-prepared welcoming page that can guide me to the information I need? (Sometimes you are just curious about release dates, and other times you might have forgotten the name of a plugin).
    > 
    > Documentation, as I understand it, should be a pleasing experience that takes you on a journey, allowing you to decide how deep you want to go.
    > 
    > The issue with 11ty's documentation is that every single page is overwhelming with technical details introduced right away. There is no foreplay, no gentle introduction‚Äîjust straight into the details. I hate it; it makes me feel like it‚Äôs designed as a gatekeeper of knowledge (I've seen this in my previous companies too).
    > 
    > Designing documentation should start with simple ideas that gradually lead to more complex concepts (just like in coding, where we start with variables and functions before moving on to more complex structures like classes and logic). Simplified diagrams are also a very welcoming idea for a starter page.

    > To make it more 11ty-focused, their documentation is missing:
    > 
    > 1. A welcoming page explaining what you are currently seeing and what you can expect.
    > 
    > 2. A simple go-to project, rather than an overwhelming list of 30+ startup projects (why not just showcase a simple blog with one post?).
    > 
    > 3. A "Set up your first project" page (I‚Äôve chosen my first project, where should I go next?).
    > 
    > 4. Instructions on how to extend your project (covering advanced topics like modules).
    > 
    > 5. General organization‚Äîthe whole page is cluttered with too many links, text blocks, paragraphs, and images.

    Another interesting thing to think about Jonathan MirCha‚Äôs Curso Eleventy brings up is internationalization. Whether 11ty is ready to take that on is the first conversation there I suppose.

# Other outcomes

- @rdela: Empower more people to contribute to and participate in documenting the 11ty ecosystem.
- @riewarden: (paraphrased) Ensure docs are written with non-technical people in mind.

# Improve entry points

@rdela: 

It‚Äôs interesting to think about entry points to the docs as something that could be improved. In order of discovery, points of first contact, we have: 

1. ‚ÄúEleventy is a simpler static site generator‚Äù‚ÄîAn aside: whether or not ‚Äúsimpler‚Äù is accurate üòÖ, I switched to ‚Äúaward-winning open source site generator‚Äù on [eleventeen](https://eleventeen.blog/about/), which I got from [Zach‚Äôs site](https://www.zachleat.com/). I definitely think Eleventy is *elegant*, powerful, and performant, and [in the words of Dan Forsyth](https://rdela.tumblr.com/post/13699704519), ‚ÄúElegance is power cloaked in simplicity.‚Äù Maybe this emphasis on simplicity instead of, say, elegance and power, makes people feel alienated that they didn‚Äôt immediately grasp, and become adept, or even expert at its ‚Äúsimpler‚Äù workflow.

2. Below that [Homepage Quick Start](https://www.11ty.dev/#quick-start) which links on to [Docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/), see below, and [6 minutes to Build a Blog from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzf9A9tkkl4) on YouTube, subtly. Further down on the homepage we get: 
   - Sponsors (&lt;sponsors-list&gt;) (maybe better further down the page?)
   - then [News from the Blog](https://www.11ty.dev/#news-from-the-blog) (useful, could come sooner in my opinion)
   - [Why should you use Eleventy?](https://www.11ty.dev/#why-should-you-use-eleventy) (ditto)
   - then [Open Collective Supporters](https://www.11ty.dev/#open-collective-supporters) &lt;facepile&gt; (why not next to sponsors? maybe further down the page?)
   - THEN GIANT DOCS BUTTON (literally &lt;giant-docs-button&gt;)
   - then [Built With Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/#built-with-eleventy) (which why not nearer to Why use &lt;logo-cloud&gt; ? Also this and everything below it gets covered by THE GIANT DOCS BUTTON, which while funny is not a great experience)
   - then author &lt;facepile&gt; (maybe further down the page? or on a separate page? facepile overkill?)
   - then [Don‚Äôt take my word for it üåà](https://www.11ty.dev/#dont-take-my-word-for-it-%F0%9F%8C%88-rainbow) testimonial quotes
   - then [Alternatives](https://www.11ty.dev/#alternatives)
   - and then finally [Subscribe to the 11ty Newsletter](https://www.11ty.dev/#subscribe-to-the-11ty-newsletter) and the footer links‚ÄîSee [Edit Page/Missing something?](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/3388#issuecomment-2256675366) thoughts above, also thought ‚ÄúImprove these docs‚Äù might be good in conjunction with ‚ÄúMissing something?‚Äù or on its own‚Äîand is [Contributor Account](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/account/) still a thing?

3. [Docs > Get Started](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/#get-started)

4. Then kind of a buffet of of [Tutorials and Starter Projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/#tutorials-and-starter-projects) leading with Eleventy Base Blog and including some of the ones I added here without referencing this.

5. Then aforementioned [More From the Community](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/#more-from-the-community) that two links at the beginning of this comment came from.

6. Then puzzlingly, another [Getting Started:](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/#getting-started) with buttons labeled‚Ä¶

   - [Command Line Usage](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/usage/)
   - [Glossary](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/glossary/)
   - [Tutorials](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/tutorials/)
   - [Starter Projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/)
   - [Performance](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/performance/)
   - [Programmatic API](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/programmatic/)
   - [Deployment & Hosting](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/deployment/)
   - [Using a CMS](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/cms/)

   Feels like this would be more aptly named ‚ÄúKeep Exploring,‚Äù ‚ÄúKeep Learning,‚Äù ‚ÄúOther Topics,‚Äù or similar.
